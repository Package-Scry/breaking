### âš  BREAKING CHANGES

* Node 8 and 9 no longer supported, use Node 10 or greater. It might still work, but it has reached End-Of-Life.
* module no longer takes `unwind`, `unwindBlank`, `flatten` or the `flattenSeparator` options, instead see the new `transforms` option. CLI options are unchanged from the callers side, but use the built in transforms under the hood.

* Add support for transforms

* Add documentation about transforms
* remove extra commonjs build, use starting point in package.json `main` field.
* Renamed `doubleQuote` to `escapedQuote`
* remove `stringify` option
* `--fields-config` option has been removed, use the new `--config` option for all configuration, not just fields.
* Drop node 6 and 7, and add node 11 and 12
